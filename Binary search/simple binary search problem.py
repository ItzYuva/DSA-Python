"""
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
"""


def search(nums, target):
    start = 0
    end = len(nums) - 1
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            start = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] > target:
            end = mid - 1
    return -1

# time complexity will be O(log n) because we are dividing the search space in half with each iteration of the loop.

print(search([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 9))  # Output: 4
print(search([-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], 2))  # Output: -1
